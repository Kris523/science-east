# Science East Volunteering Code

This is just a grouping of code that I brought together and adjusted to fit needs for Science East. 
Science East is my local STEM center, which I try and help out with.

The repo holds all thing that I have created for them:

  - Person Tracking: 
    - This was a webpage that live streamed on port 80, and ran a caffemodel for facial detection. It then would store the faces. All of this was to demo that techology can easily be watching us all the time!
  - TOADD: Light Music  
- Scripts:
  - resizeTiff.py : resizes a tiff image using opencv and writes it as a png. Did you know that printer mess up if the image is too high resolution?
